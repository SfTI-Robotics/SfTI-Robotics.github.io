##Layers
##NN vs Layers(dense)
Tensorflow proposes on the one hand a low level API (tf., tf.nn....), and on the other hand, a higher level API (tf.layers., tf.losses.,...).
The goal of the higher level API is to provide functions that greatly simplify the design of the most common neural nets. The lower level API is there for people with special needs, or who wishes to keep a finer control of what is going on.
###Dense()
Is a class that inherits from layers
Just your regular densely-connected NN layer.Eg:
