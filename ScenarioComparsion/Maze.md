# Maze Environment Scenario Comparsion

## Maze Enviornment
The maze environment involves a 4x4 grid space that involves an red rectangle acting as an agent that traverses through the gird world to find the yellow oval target. This marks the compeletion of the episode when the red rectangle has successfully reached the destination of the yellow oval. The grid space also contains black squares which act as black holes and terminate the episode if the agent intereacts with that grid module. The goal of the agent is to reach the target yellow oval with the least amount of steps it can take from the starting position.
