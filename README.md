# Reinforcement Learning|National Science challenge
## Welcome to the club

This project aim for a robot arm to use reinforcement learning to complete different tasks you will be supervised by Tony and Henry if you have any questions ask them.
This website is mainly to help you get started and then focuses heavily on coding syntax.

First I would recommend installing the following program(use google- they normally have instructions):

1) Ubuntu 18.04:
  This can be install by first splitting up your drive(disk mangement) into two partitions and the part you will use needs to     be atleast 30gb and shrink volume-> get free space make sure not more than 4.Then boot up in BIOS change boot order with       ubuntu first.And use tony's usb with burnt ubuntu copy and boot into it.
  
2) Python 2.7 
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
3) ROS melodic
  
4) Tensorflow 
   ```
   pip install tensorflow #(CPU-Only)
   pip install tensorflow-gpu#(GPU)
   ```
   
5) Keras 
   ```
   pip(3) install keras
   ```
  
  Environment simulation packages: 
  
1) [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)
   
2) OpenAI Retro

3) Gazebo 9


### What now?


You're going to need to learn alot of information about RL this may take you a few weeks to a month. To give you a head start the original T4 have courteously created a [crash course](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kUGb7GeAGOXibj2j9bKyk6hMWCEkN-kG) on google drive (ask iqra if you still haven't been added). This is a very basic overview of the content to get into specifics see david silver lectures, use Richard Sutton RL textbooks or just plain old google but most importantly try and work toghether as much as you can. 

Once you're alright with the theory start going into Openai Gym and look at what code other people have done.
