# National Science challenge

Welcome this organisation is the Github repo for the SFTI Robotics spearhead project. All code and documentation for this project will be stored and managed here.

## Base System Requirements

These are the base requirements that all code is aimed to operate with unless otherwise specified for techincal reasons. If certain systems require other versions we will find work arounds, but unless otherwise required we aim to operate with these versions. There are expectations that we will upgrade when possible to keep up to date with security and feature upgrades as required throughout the life of the project.

* Ubuntu 18.04
* ROS 1.0 Melodic
  * Python 2.N
  * OpenCV 3.0
  * c++XX (recommend c++11 at least).
